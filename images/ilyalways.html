        <h1>To my dearest, Sharmaine</h1>
        <p>As you're reading this, you might be thinking, "Bakit ko ginawa itong website?" But before that, I want to express muna how I feel about you. I've made so many mistakes in the past and might make more in the future, but I want you to know that I will always make myself better for you, progressingly, might take days, weeks, months, or even years.</p>
        <p>I want to thank you for being the best woman in my life, definitely the best thing that ever happened to me. Thank you for every sacrifice you've made, for every love you've made me feel, for caring about me, for being my best friend, for being my partner, for being my lover. Atp, I'm crying na while typing this message.</p>
        <p>So, going back to the question, why did I make this website?</p>
        <p>I made this website as a sign of my presence being always there as you use it for your academics. But to be honest, the real reason might be that this website will serve as me, helping you even if I'm not around anymore. I'm scared to think that in the future, you will need my help and I might not be there to help you. I'm scared, sorry.</p>
        <p>I hope this will be very helpful for you as you progress in college.
        <br/>I will always love you, mimaws. May the universe continue to give you the best in your life.
        <br/>
        <br/>I love you, always and forever.</p>
